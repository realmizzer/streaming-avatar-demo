# HeyGen Streaming Avatar Demo
I'm just playing with HeyGen API to create interactive avatars, nothing genius :)

## How to Run
- Clone the repository;
- Copy and paste your HeyGen API token in the `VITE_HEYGEN_API_KEY` field in `.env` (you can get it from this [url](https://app.heygen.com/settings?nav=API));
- Open a terminal in the project folder and type `npm install`;
- Start dev server with this command `npm run dev`;
- ???
- Enjoy!

## Additionally
Sometimes the «Start Session» button doesn't work. Wait for 30-60 seconds and press again. Or check console for errors, if there is error with status 400, try to press start button again.
